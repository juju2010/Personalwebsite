        I love to play sqaush. I have been playing it competitively for about 2 years. This sport help helps you with hand-eye coordination and it help with cardio. I play squash 6 times a week. This sport should be more well-known as it is one the the, if not the healthiest sport in the world. I did not know about this sport until my parents told me about it. After school, I would go to the squash court and play for fun or to do my lessons. Squash is very fun to play and more people should play it.
